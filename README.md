# MatrixSolversComp
A crude implementation of Classic solvers and Krylov subspace solvers to compare their convergence.

This project compare convergence for the next (poorly efficient implemented) linear equation solvers:

-Jacobi
-Gauss-Seidel
-Succesive Over-relaxation Method
-Conjugated Gradient
-Biconjugated Gradient Stabilized
-Generalized Minimal Residual (without restarting)

Examples were made for Laplace 2D with Finite Difference Method and Laplace 2D
and Advection-Diffussion with Radial Basis Function Method.
